# Image-Bot

NOTE: This is moving files to a Google Drive mount using rclone. Can change directory to where ever you want...

This is not meant to be used in a serious manner as it will download ANY attached image, twitter, gyfcat or instagram thumbnail.

This bot will downlod images from a respective discord and move them to gdrive. It is dirty code. 

This code is not top of the line, instead is thrown together in minimal effort so expect inconsistency.
# Requirements
NodeJS 6+
Discord.JS (npm install --save discord.js)
https (npm install https)
fs (npm install fs)

# Config

Replace the config.token at the bottom with your bot token.
